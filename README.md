Developed a loan request form application using React to enhance form state management and conditional rendering. Implemented real-time validation to ensure required fields are filled correctly before submission, disabling the submit button if any criteria are unmet. Upon submission, a modal provides feedback, confirming successful submission or highlighting specific errors ( invalid age or incorrect phone number format). This project demonstrates efficient handling of dynamic form validation, user feedback, and controlled component state.
